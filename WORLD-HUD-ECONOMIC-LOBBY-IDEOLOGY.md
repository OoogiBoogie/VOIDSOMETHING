# WORLD HUD - ECONOMIC LOBBY IDEOLOGY

## 🎯 Core Principle

**The WORLD HUD is not just UI — it's a living economic lobby that routes attention and intent into all hubs.**

Every widget either:
1. **Surfaces state** from another hub (CREATOR, DEFI, DAO, AGENCY, AI OPS)
2. **Offers a one-click action** into that hub

**No "dead" cards. Everything is an on-ramp.**

---

## 🏛️ Hub Roles (Economic Ideology)

### WORLD – Social layer + presence
Where people hang out, explore districts, and discover opportunities.

### CREATOR – Launchpad & royalty engine
Creator tokens, drops, IP-building, metaverse land, BYOT.

### DEFI – VOID / LP / emission machine
Vaults, staking, yields, FRAME/FEY/ZORA hooks, 1155 partner protocol.

### DAO – PSX governance brain
Proposals, votes, parameters, emission rules.

### AGENCY – Jobs, pledges, IP-building
Agencies, squads, gigs, contributors, PSX pledges.

### AI OPS – Automated strategy + safety
VaultAI, EmissionAI, MissionAI, GovernanceAI.

## 🟩 Top Band: Macro Economy Bar

### PlayerChip (LEFT) → Multi-hub identity
Shows who you are across ALL hubs:

**WORLD progression:**
- XP / Level / Zone / Coordinates

**DEFI stake:**
- VOID balance (liquid + staked)
- SIGNAL balance (emissions)

**DAO power:**
- PSX balance
- Voting power multiplier

**CREATOR earnings:**
- CREATE tokens (royalties)

**AGENCY role:**
- Badge: "VOID OPS / FREELANCE / GUILD"
- Pledge status: PSX_PLEDGED / RECRUITING

**Ideology:** Player always sees their economic position across hubs, not just WORLD stats.

---

### TopTicker (CENTER) → Pulse of the economy
Rolling announcements from ALL hubs:

**DEFI:**
- `VOID $1.23 (+4.2%) · SIGNAL epoch 132 · 1.32× multiplier`

**DAO:**
- `PSX $0.45 · Proposal #27 ends in 2h`

**CREATOR:**
- `CREATE mint "Lattice Dreams #01" in District 7 now live`

**AI OPS:**
- `EmissionAI suggests tilt toward creators this epoch`

**AGENCY:**
- `3 new gigs posted in Gaming District`

**Ideology:** Ticker is economic pulse, not random news. Each item tagged by hub with color coding.

---

### MiniMap (RIGHT) → Spatial economy
Shows WORLD map with POIs tagged by hub:

**CREATOR POIs:**
- 🎨 Creator drop locations (cyber-cyan)

**DEFI POIs:**
- 🏦 Vault entrances (void-purple)

**DAO POIs:**
- 🗳️ Proposal terminals (psx-blue)

**AGENCY POIs:**
- 💼 Job boards (red)

**AI OPS POIs:**
- 🌟 Hotspots (signal-green, pulsing)

**Ideology:** Map shows where economic activity is happening spatially. Click → opens MAP app with hub filters.

---

## 🟨 Left Gutter: Micro Missions Feed

### Operator Panel → WORLD + AGENCY
- Level / Streak (WORLD)
- Role: Explorer / Builder / Agent (AGENCY)
- Agency badge: "PSX pledged" / "Recruiting"

---

### Quick Missions → Cross-hub gateways
Each mission tagged by hub:

**[WORLD]** Visit a new district → exploration
**[CREATOR]** Support 1 creator drop → CreatorHub
**[DEFI]** Stake into a VOID vault → DeFiHub
**[DAO]** Vote in 1 proposal → GovernanceHub
**[AGENCY]** Apply to 1 project → AgencyHub

**Ideology:** Missions are macro → micro gateways. Each one routes into its hub on click.

---

### Daily Streak + Achievements → Meta
- Rewards in SIGNAL + reputation flags
- Some tied to specific hubs:
  - "First DAO vote"
  - "First creator support"
  - "First vault stake"

---

### Social Snapshot → WORLD + AGENCY + CREATOR
- Friends online: 7 (WORLD)
- In this district: 2 (WORLD)
- Projects recruiting: 3 (AGENCY + CREATOR)

**Ideology:** Tap "Projects recruiting" → opens Agency/Creator filtered job board.

---

## 🟨 Right Gutter: Back-end Brain

### Emission Status → DEFI + AI OPS
- Current multiplier, epoch countdown
- Tag: `Source: EmissionAI policy v4.2`
- Click → DeFiHub or AI OPS for details

---

### AI Feed → AI OPS + all hubs
Short log lines showing AI agent activity:

**[VaultAI]** rebalanced pools toward creator tokens *(DEFI)*
**[MissionAI]** new high-yield quests in District 3 *(WORLD)*
**[GovernanceAI]** proposal 27 trending, risk low *(DAO)*
**[AgencyAI]** suggests joining squad "Chromelink" *(AGENCY)*

**Ideology:** AI OPS is not abstract — it's actively steering the economy. Feed shows real-time actions.

---

### Recent Rewards → All tokens
List of last actions + token outputs:

- Mission complete · **+35 SIGNAL**
- Creator support · **+12 CREATE +2 VOID**
- DAO vote · **+3 PSX reputation pts**

**Ideology:** Constant feedback loop showing how participation hits the economy.

---

### Chat Panel → WORLD + AGENCY + CREATOR
Tabs:
- **GLOBAL** – entire world feed
- **NEARBY** – district local (deals, collabs)
- **PARTY/GUILD** – squads, agencies

System messages from other hubs appear here:

**[Agency]** New gig in this district: level designer needed
**[Creator]** Drop "Lattice Dreams #01" minted 23% in last 10m

**Ideology:** Chat is not just social — it's also market information surface.

---

## 🔵 Center Blue Zone: WORLD Viewport

**Pure 3D world + subtle shaders:**
- Chrome lattice overlay in certain zones
- Dreamcore gradient backgrounds in skybox
- Diegetic mission markers (floating in world, not 2D)

**Ideology:** Safe play area enforced. HUD never blocks character.

---

## 🟫 Bottom Band: Action Layer

### ContextActionBar → Hub-aware verbs
Dynamic prompts:

- `[E] OPEN VAULT TERMINAL` (DEFI)
- `[F] TALK TO CREATOR` (CREATOR / WORLD)
- `[Q] SCAN JOB BOARD` (AGENCY)
- `[R] OPEN PROPOSAL CONSOLE` (DAO)

**Ideology:** Not generic "Press E" — context knows which hub you're interacting with.

---

### BottomAppDock → Grouped by ideology

**Left half = social & creative:**
- Phone, Friends, Guilds, Voice, Music, Games (WORLD + CREATOR)

**Right half = economic & structural:**
- Map, Vault, Wallet, DAO, Agency, AI Ops (DEFI + DAO + AGENCY + AI OPS)

**Ideology:** Apps are portals. Each one opens a specific hub's interface.

---

## 🎨 Chrome + Dreamcore With Hub Ideology

**Visual language:**
- Each hub has its accent color + chrome texture
- Widgets use hub colors to show which subsystem they touch

**Hub accents:**
| Hub | Color | Chrome Style |
|-----|-------|--------------|
| WORLD | signal-green, cyan | flowing lattice |
| CREATOR | cyber-cyan | liquid chrome blobs |
| DEFI | void-purple | harder chrome edges, waveforms |
| DAO | psx-blue | sharp glyphs/runes |
| AGENCY | red | industrial chrome plates, warning strips |
| AI OPS | purple/green mix | code-rain overlays |

**Ideology in color:**
- DEFI mission card → void-purple
- DAO proposal announcement → psx-blue
- Agency gig ping → red
- Creator drop → cyber-cyan
- AI hotspot → signal-green

**Just by color, you know which hub you're touching.**

---

## 📊 Data Flow (Keeping Ideology Intact)

### Anti-Pattern ❌
```tsx
<PlayerChip 
  username="Operator" 
  voidBalance={123} 
  psxBalance={456}
/>
```
**Problem:** Component invents random numbers. No connection to economy.

---

### Correct Pattern ✅
```tsx
// 1. Fetch economic snapshot from all hubs
const snapshot: EconomySnapshot = {
  world: { zone, coords, onlineFriends, nearbyProjects, districts },
  creator: { royalties, trendingDrops, activeLaunches },
  defi: { voidPrice, emissionMultiplier, vaults, myPositions },
  dao: { activeProposals, votingPower, psxBalance },
  agency: { myRole, openGigs, pledges, squadsOnline },
  aiOps: { logs, hotspots, suggestions, riskFlags },
};

// 2. Pass hub-scoped data to layout
<WorldHUDLayout
  snapshot={snapshot}
  player={playerState}
/>

// 3. Components read from snapshot
<PlayerChip
  player={playerState}
  world={snapshot.world}
  defi={snapshot.defi}
  dao={snapshot.dao}
  creator={snapshot.creator}
  agency={snapshot.agency}
/>

<TopTicker
  defi={snapshot.defi}
  dao={snapshot.dao}
  creator={snapshot.creator}
  aiOps={snapshot.aiOps}
  agency={snapshot.agency}
  tickerItems={snapshot.tickerItems}
/>

<MiniMap
  world={snapshot.world}
  pois={snapshot.pois}
  aiHotspots={snapshot.aiOps.hotspots}
/>
```

**Ideology:** UI never invents data. It always reflects the economic engine.

---

## 🔄 Action Flow (Portal Pattern)

Every action in WORLD HUD should:

1. **Show current state** from relevant hub
2. **Provide one-click navigation** into that hub
3. **Update state** when user takes action in hub
4. **Reflect changes** back in WORLD HUD

**Example: Mission Flow**
1. User sees `[DEFI] Stake into a vault` mission in LeftRail
2. Click → navigates to DeFiHub, pre-filtered to vaults
3. User stakes 100 VOID
4. WORLD HUD updates:
   - Mission progress: 100%
   - Recent rewards: `+50 SIGNAL`
   - PlayerChip: VOID balance decreases
   - TopTicker: `DEFI: Vault TVL +100 VOID`

**Ideology:** WORLD HUD is always in sync with the economy. Actions in hubs flow back.

---

## 🧠 AI OPS Integration

AI agents surface in WORLD HUD to guide player decisions:

**EmissionAI:** `Tilt toward creators this epoch` → Creator mission cards highlighted
**VaultAI:** `Rebalanced pools` → DEFI section shows updated APYs
**GovernanceAI:** `Proposal 27 trending, risk low` → DAO card shows green flag
**AgencyAI:** `Join squad "Chromelink"` → Agency recruitment card appears
**MissionAI:** `High-yield quests in District 3` → Minimap shows hotspot

**Ideology:** AI is not hidden backend logic. It's visible, steering, responsive.

---

## ✅ Design Checklist

For every new widget in WORLD HUD, ask:

- [ ] Which hub does this surface?
- [ ] What action does it route to?
- [ ] What data does it need from EconomySnapshot?
- [ ] What color/chrome accent shows its hub?
- [ ] How does it update when economy changes?

If answers are unclear → widget is "dead" → remove or redesign.

## 🚀 Implementation Notes

### File Structure
```
hud/
├── types/
│   └── economySnapshot.ts (master types)
├── world/
│   ├── PlayerChip.tsx (multi-hub identity)
│   ├── TopTicker.tsx (economic pulse)
│   ├── MiniMap.tsx (spatial economy)
│   ├── LeftRail.tsx (micro missions)
│   ├── RightRail.tsx (back-end brain)
│   ├── ContextActionBar.tsx (hub-aware verbs)
│   └── BottomAppDock.tsx (hub portals)
└── hubs/
    └── WorldHubV2.tsx (orchestrates snapshot → components)
```

### Hooks Pattern
```tsx
// WorldHubV2.tsx
const snapshot = useEconomySnapshot(); // fetches all hub data
const player = usePlayerState();
const actions = useHubActions(); // navigate, stake, vote, etc.

return (
  <WorldHUDLayout
    snapshot={snapshot}
    player={player}
    onNavigate={actions.navigate}
    onAction={actions.execute}
  />
);
```

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

WORLD HUD is successful when:

1. **Every number comes from a hub** (no hardcoded values)
2. **Every action routes to a hub** (no dead ends)
3. **Players understand the economy** just by looking at HUD
4. **AI guidance is visible** and actionable
5. **Hub colors are instantly recognizable** (DEFI=purple, DAO=blue, etc.)
