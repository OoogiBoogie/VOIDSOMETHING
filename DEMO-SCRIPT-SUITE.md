### Full Script

**0:00-0:15 | Introduction**
> "Hi, I'm [name], and this is VOID - a Chrome Dreamcore metaverse built on Base, Coinbase's Layer 2 blockchain. What makes VOID unique is our hub mode system - six different modes that adapt the entire UI based on what you're doing. Right now we're in WORLD mode, but watch what happens when I switch to CREATOR..."

**[Switch to CREATOR hub - pink glow, cosmetics tab appears]**

**0:15-0:30 | Progression**
> "VOID has a progression system. I'm GOLD tier with 720 XP. You earn XP by completing quests, chatting, joining guilds, and contributing to the economy. This unlocks zones - I've unlocked 3 out of 7 so far. Higher tiers get access to exclusive areas and features."

**[Open Passport window - show GOLD tier, 720 XP, zone unlocks]**

**0:30-0:50 | Social Features**
> "The social layer is built-in. Here's the global chat with 8 messages from different players. You can also send encrypted DMs..." 

**[Open Global Chat, then open Phone/DM window]**

> "...and join guild channels. Everything is real-time with Server-Sent Events."

**0:50-1:10 | Guilds**
> "Guilds are player-run communities. I'm in VOID Builders, which has 42 members. In Phase 6, guilds will get their own treasuries and governance systems - basically DAOs with social features."

**[Open Guilds window - show VOID Builders]**

**1:10-1:30 | Economic Layer**
> "The Agency Board is our gig marketplace. Here's a gig to design a neon sign for 500 VOID tokens. Creators claim gigs, submit work, and get paid automatically via smart contract escrow. No middleman, no chargebacks."

**[Open Agency Board - show gig cards]**

**1:30-1:50 | Competitive Layer**
> "There's also a competitive layer - I'm currently ranked #7 on the global leaderboard with 720 XP. We have multiple leaderboards: Top XP, Top Tier, Guild Rankings, Creator Rankings. This creates multiple paths to success."

**[Open Leaderboards - show rank #7]**

**1:50-2:00 | Closing**
> "We're deploying to Base Sepolia testnet next week for public beta, with mainnet launch planned for Q1 2026. What questions can I answer?"

### Full Script

**0:00-1:00 | Tech Stack Introduction**

> "Good afternoon, I'm [name], and I want to show you VOID - but not just the product, the architecture behind it."

> "VOID is built with React 19 and Next.js 15, leveraging React Server Components for optimal performance. We're deployed on Base, Coinbase's Layer 2, which gives us 2-second block times and sub-cent transaction fees. Everything is strongly typed with TypeScript in strict mode - we have zero `any` types in production code."

**[Show HUD loading - point out economy ticker, hub switcher, bottom dock]**

> "The frontend is 100% offline-capable in demo mode. You're looking at it right now - no network requests, all data is pre-seeded. This makes it perfect for demos, but also means the app can function during blockchain downtime."

**1:00-2:00 | Hub Mode Architecture**

> "What makes VOID's UI unique is our hub mode system. Instead of one monolithic interface, we have six context-aware modes."

**[Click through each hub mode slowly]**

1. **WORLD** - "Social hub, world exploration, default mode"
2. **CREATOR** - "Cosmetics marketplace, building tools" [pink theme]
3. **DEFI** - "Wallet, swap, vault, DeFi features" [purple theme]
4. **DAO** - "Governance, proposals, voting" [yellow theme]
5. **AGENCY** - "Gig marketplace, bounties" [orange theme]
6. **AI OPS** - "AI assistants, automation" [cyan theme]

> "Each hub mode changes the theme, the available tabs, and even which bottom dock icons are highlighted. This keeps the interface clean while giving power users access to everything."

**[Switch between hubs to demonstrate theme changes]**

> "Under the hood, this is driven by a custom FX system that triggers on state changes. We're using Zustand for global state management, which keeps re-renders minimal."

**2:00-3:00 | Progression System**

> "VOID has a tier-based progression system. There are five tiers: BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD, PLATINUM, and VOID."

**[Open Passport window]**

> "I'm currently GOLD tier with 720 XP. The tier thresholds are:"
> - BRONZE: 100 XP
> - SILVER: 250 XP
> - GOLD: 600 XP
> - PLATINUM: 1500 XP

> "You earn XP by completing quests, chatting, joining guilds, and participating in the economy. This is all tracked on-chain via our VoidScore contract, which deploys next week on Base Sepolia."

**[Point to XP bar, zone unlocks]**

> "Tiers unlock zones. I've unlocked 3 out of 7: The Commons, Silicon Swamp, and Neon Harbor. Each zone has unique NPCs, quests, and aesthetics."

**3:00-4:00 | Social Layer**

> "The social layer is powered by Net Protocol - a decentralized messaging protocol we're integrating in Phase 5."

**[Open Global Chat]**

> "Here's the global chat. Right now it's showing 8 demo messages, but in production this will be real-time with Server-Sent Events. Messages are capped at 100 per view to prevent performance issues."

**[Open Phone/DM window]**

> "DMs will be end-to-end encrypted using public/private key cryptography. Only the sender and recipient can read them - not us, not anyone. This is critical for user privacy in a decentralized metaverse."

**[Show DM thread with Alice]**

> "We're also adding anti-spam measures: daily caps, wallet age checks, and tier-based boosts. A GOLD tier user can send 50% more messages than a BRONZE tier user."

**4:00-5:00 | Economic Systems**

> "Let's talk about the economic layer."

**[Switch to AGENCY hub, open Agency Board]**

> "This is the Agency Board - a decentralized gig marketplace. Here's a gig to design a neon sign for 500 VOID tokens. When you claim a gig, the payment goes into a smart contract escrow. When you submit your work and it's approved, the contract automatically releases funds. No middleman, no disputes."

**[Point to gig cards]**

> "Gig types range from creative (design, 3D modeling) to technical (smart contracts, bug fixes) to social (community moderation, event hosting). This creates a self-sustaining economy where players earn by contributing value."

**[Switch to DEFI hub]**

> "In Phase 6, we'll add DeFi features: token swaps via Uniswap V3, staking pools, and yield farming. The xVOID vault is already deployed on testnet - you can stake VOID to earn xVOID, which has governance rights."

**5:00-6:00 | 3D World Map**

> "Finally, let me show you the 3D world map."

**[Open World Map window]**

> "This is rendered with Three.js. It shows all 7 zones in VOID's metaverse. Each zone has a distinct visual style - The Commons is gray brutalism, Silicon Swamp is green biopunk, Neon Harbor is cyan neon, etc."

**[If World Map renders, navigate around]**

> "In Phase 6, you'll be able to click a zone to teleport there, see real-time player counts, and explore in first-person 3D. We're building this with WASD controls and collision detection."

> "The 3D engine is optimized for web - we're using instanced meshes, occlusion culling, and LOD (level of detail) to keep it smooth even on low-end GPUs."

**6:00-7:00 | Q&A + Roadmap**

> "That's the 7-minute tour of VOID. Let me quickly cover the roadmap:"

> - **Phase 5 (Next Week):** Base Sepolia testnet deployment, invite-only beta
> - **Phase 6 (Weeks 6-8):** Public testnet beta, bug bounties
> - **Phase 7 (Weeks 10-12):** Smart contract audit, security review
> - **Phase 8 (Week 14):** Mainnet launch on Base, public release

> "I'm happy to answer technical questions about the architecture, smart contracts, or anything else."

### XP Triggers

**None** - Demo mode static data

### Toast Events

**Possible:**
- Quest completion toast when discussing XP system (optional, pre-recorded)
- Guild invite toast when opening Guilds (optional)

### Reveal Sequence

1. HUD overview (0:00)
2. All 6 hub modes (1:00-2:00)
3. Passport / Progression (2:00)
4. Global Chat (3:00)
5. DMs (3:30)
6. Agency Board (4:00)
7. DeFi hub (4:40)
8. World Map (5:00)

### Technical Q&A Prep

**Q: What's the bundle size?**
> "Client bundle is ~280KB gzipped. Server components reduce this by 40% compared to a pure client-side React app."

**Q: How do you handle chain downtime?**
> "Offline mode with localStorage caching. Blockchain transactions queue locally and sync when the chain recovers."

**Q: Gas costs?**
> "On Base, a message costs ~0.001 cents. A gig payment costs ~0.005 cents. Affordable for mainstream users."

**Q: Why not use IPFS for messages?**
> "IPFS is for static assets (cosmetics, images). Messages need real-time updates, so we use Net Protocol with SSE."

**Q: Security audits?**
> "Scheduled for Phase 7 (Weeks 10-12). We're using OpenZeppelin contracts as a foundation, but custom logic will be audited by Trail of Bits."

### Full Script

**0:00-2:00 | Problem & Solution**

> "Thank you for taking the time to meet with me. I'm [name], and I'm here to talk about VOID - a Chrome Dreamcore metaverse on Base."

> "The problem we're solving is metaverse fragmentation. Today, if you want to socialize, you use Discord. If you want to trade NFTs, you use OpenSea. If you want to play games, you use separate platforms. There's no unified metaverse where you can do all of these things in one coherent experience."

> "VOID solves this by building a multi-hub metaverse on Base, Coinbase's Layer 2. Instead of forcing users into one experience, we have six hub modes - social, creative, DeFi, DAO, agency, and AI - that adapt the UI based on context. This keeps the interface clean while providing depth."

**[Show HUD - demonstrate hub mode switching]**

> "We're also addressing the blockchain UX problem. Most crypto apps are clunky, slow, and expensive. VOID runs on Base, which has 2-second finality and sub-cent fees. Our frontend is React Server Components for optimal performance, and we're 100% offline-capable in demo mode."

**2:00-4:00 | Product Demo**

**[Abbreviated version of 7-minute demo, focusing on key features]**

1. **Hub modes** (30s) - Show WORLD, CREATOR, DEFI
2. **Progression system** (30s) - GOLD tier, 720 XP, zone unlocks
3. **Social features** (1min) - Global chat, encrypted DMs, guilds
4. **Economic layer** (1min) - Agency Board gigs, smart contract escrow
5. **Competitive layer** (30s) - Leaderboards, rank #7

> "What you're seeing is our demo mode with pre-seeded data. Next week, this deploys to Base Sepolia testnet with real wallet connections, on-chain XP tracking, and live price oracles."

**4:00-6:00 | Market Opportunity**

> "Let's talk about the market."

> **TAM (Total Addressable Market):**
> - Global gaming market: $200B+ annually
> - Metaverse platforms: $61B by 2027 (Bloomberg Intelligence)
> - Web3 gaming: $38B by 2025

> **SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market):**
> - Base L2 ecosystem: $10B+ TVL (Total Value Locked)
> - Coinbase user base: 110M+ verified users
> - Metaverse on Ethereum/L2s: $5B+ market cap

> **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):**
> - Year 1 target: 10,000 active users
> - Year 3 target: 100,000 active users
> - Conservative penetration: 0.1% of Base users

> **Competitors:**
> - Decentraland: $500M+ market cap, but clunky UX, Ethereum L1 (slow/expensive)
> - The Sandbox: $800M+ market cap, limited social features
> - Roblox: 70M+ DAU, but Web2, no crypto integration

> **VOID's Differentiation:**
> 1. **Multi-hub architecture** - One platform, six experiences
> 2. **Base L2** - Fast, cheap, mainstream-friendly
> 3. **Social-first** - Built-in chat, guilds, DMs (not an afterthought)
> 4. **Creator economy** - 97.5% revenue share for creators (vs. 70% on Roblox)

**6:00-8:00 | Business Model**

> "VOID has four revenue streams:"

> **1. Marketplace Fees (2.5%)**
> - Creators sell cosmetics, keep 97.5%
> - Example: $10M annual GMV → $250K revenue

> **2. Premium Subscriptions (VoidPRO)**
> - $9.99/month for exclusive perks
> - 1,000 subs → $120K annual revenue

> **3. Agency Fees (5%)**
> - Platform fee on gig payments
> - Example: $5M annual gig volume → $250K revenue

> **4. Token Appreciation**
> - Treasury holds 20% of VOID supply
> - If VOID reaches $0.50 (10x from launch), treasury = $10M+

> **Unit Economics:**
> - CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost): $5 (social media ads)
> - LTV (Lifetime Value): $50 (marketplace fees + subscriptions)
> - LTV/CAC Ratio: 10:1 (healthy for SaaS/gaming)

> **Break-Even Analysis:**
> - 5,000 active users → $500K annual revenue → Break-even

**8:00-10:00 | Traction & Roadmap**

> "We're currently in Phase 4.6 - demo hardening. Here's what we've built:"

> **Current Traction:**
> - 57,000+ lines of documentation
> - 14 E2E tests, 100% passing
> - 6 comprehensive audits, 0 critical bugs
> - 0 technical debt blocking deployment

> **Roadmap:**
> - **Phase 5 (Week 5):** Base Sepolia testnet, invite-only beta
> - **Phase 6 (Weeks 6-8):** Public beta, 1,000+ testers
> - **Phase 7 (Weeks 10-12):** Smart contract audit (Trail of Bits)
> - **Phase 8 (Week 14):** Mainnet launch, public release

### Investor Q&A Prep

**Q: What's your moat?**
> "Multi-hub architecture is unique. Competitors are single-purpose. Network effects: more creators → more cosmetics → more players."

**Q: How do you acquire users?**
> "Coinbase has 110M users. We're working on a Base ecosystem grant. Influencer partnerships on Twitter/YouTube."

**Q: What if Base fails?**
> "We're EVM-compatible. Can deploy to Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon in <1 week. User data is off-chain, so it's portable."

**Q: Regulatory risk?**
> "VOID token is utility, not security. Used for in-game purchases and governance. Legal opinion from [Law Firm]."

**Q: Team risk (solo founder)?**
> "Hiring CTO next month. [Advisor] is helping with recruitment. Roadmap assumes 3-person team by Month 3."
